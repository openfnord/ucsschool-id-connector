# Generate the id_broker client code

1. Download the OpenAPI schema from and store it in `src/plugins/packages/idbroker/provisioning_openapi.json`.
2. On your dev machine, execute `build_provisioning_api_openapi_client`. If this doesn't work execute the command inside.

Please commit the generated code in a dedicated commit. This makes the QA happy.
