<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h2>v2.0.0 (2020-10-??)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
	    Support for replicating to target systems exposing the <a href="https://docs.software-univention.de/ucsschool-kelvin-rest-api">UCS@school Kelvin REST API</a> was added.
	</li>
	<li>
	    The school authority configuration was changed to allow the configuration of plugins. An automatic migration will be done in the join script. If it fails, the UCS@school ID connector will not start. Please read the log file <code>/var/log/univention/ucsschool-id-connector/queues.log</code>. To rerun the migration script, execute: <code>univention-run-join-scripts --run-scripts --force 50ucsschool-id-connector.inst</code>. It is discouraged to edit the configuration files directly. But in case it becomes necessary, they are located in <code>/var/lib/univention-appcenter/apps/ucsschool-id-connector/conf/school_authorities</code>. To restart the UCS@school ID Connector, execute: <code>univention-app shell ucsschool-id-connector /etc/init.d/ucsschool-id-connector restart</code>
